# What is a blockchain?
Put simply, blockchains provide a way to keep track of digitized value without the need for intermediaries, such as banks and other financial institutions.

# What is Ethereum Classic?
Ethereum Classic (ETC) is a blockchain, a network, and a cryptocurrency that takes digitized value further. In addition to allowing people to send value to each other, ETC allows people to create complex contracts that operate autonomously and cannot be modified or censored. This can be a difficult concept to grasp for those new to the blockchain space. For now, imagine Bitcoin as a landline phoneâ€”it does one thing very well: make phone calls. From this perspective, ETC is like a smartphone: it can make phone calls, but it is capable of a vastly wider range of functions as well.

ETC is also:
* A fair and open community
* A blockchain with a long history of operation
* A blockchain on which all transactions are immutable, or permanent; if someone sends you value on the ETC blockchain, it is yours forever
* The future of internet of things (IoT) blockchain applications

# Why ETC?
Blockchains represent many things. They are an innovative technology and often a cryptocurrency, and tight-knit communities tend to form around them. ETC is a cryptocurrency as well as a smart contract platform, and it's important that we take our role seriously and understand our limits.

## Immutability
ETC "accounts" cannot be modified by others. This feature is a philosophy we share with Bitcoin, Litecoin, and other cryptocurrencies.

Some blockchains follow a different philosophy. Governance, or the means by which blockchains decide on modifications to their underlying technology, is an important aspect of blockchains, but some blockchains allow participants to use their economic power to vote on the account balances of others. Imagine if all the members of your bank believed you had broken a law, and instead of going to the police, those with the biggest balances simply voted to take away your money. A fundamental aspect of ETC is that this will never be allowed to happen, and historical precedent has demonstrated this to be the case.

## Technology
ETC allows highly efficient value transfers (more so than Bitcoin and its variants), has a focus on IoT applications, and runs a mathematically verified Ethereum Virtual Machine, or EVM. What this means is that ETC is great at what it sets out to do: be a highly efficient means of exchange that connects the world's devices.

IoT features are under active development and will be available later this year.

## Community
Many blockchain communities have centralized leadership, meaning a few people at the top make the decisions for everyone else. ETC's community is purposely structured to avoid this. Responsibility for development and for other parts of the community are distributed between many parties. This prevents the biased form of governance that blockchains can easily fall victim to.

# Ethereum Classic & The Ethereum Foundation
ETC was founded from a fundamental disagreement about the degree to which people should be allowed to manage other people's finances.

The Ethereum Foundation believes that in certain cases it is OK for account balances to be changed by the community, vigilante-style. The Ethereum Classic community believes that this type of vigilante justice is antithetical to the spirit of blockchain.

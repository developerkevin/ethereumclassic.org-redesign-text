# Getting ETC
You have two options to get ETC, one is to buy it on an exchange, the other is to mine it with computer hardware.

## Exchanges
To obtain ETC you can join one of the many exchanges linked in the [Exchange](/#exchange) section.

## Mining
To mine ETC you'll need to have the appropriate computer hardware and join one of the many [ETC mining pools](/#pools) available. If you've never mined before then make sure to read up on what's required first. You can find many guides and information in the mining pools section.

# ETC History
ETC has a long history relative to most blockchains and came about at the start of the second wave of blockchains.

Ultimately you can break down blockchains and Cryptocurrencies into two waves:

Wave 1 (2009-2013): Bitcoin, and Bitcoin clones (aka. "altcoins").
Wave 2 (2014-Present): Contract coins, Privacy coins, etc.

Ethereum Classic belongs to the second wave of coins.

Ethereum Classic is the Ethereum blockchain, much like Coca Cola Classic is the original and better Coke, we are the original and better Ethereum. Where-as New Coke (or New Ethereum) is a compromise that ruined a lot of what made Ethereum great.

## A History Lesson
Ethereum launched on July 30th 2015. At this time there was only one Ethereum with the goal of being a decentralized, immutable, blockchain-powered machine.

ETC's very own EtherNinja is permanently recorded in block 4: https://etherscan.io/block/4

The first Bitcoin-proponent made it into block 18, funny that they were mining Ethereum: https://etherscan.io/block/18

For the first year the Ethereum community was one small but happy family. Then some of the leaders at EF/Slock.It decided to create a Decentralized Autonomous Organization ("The DAO").

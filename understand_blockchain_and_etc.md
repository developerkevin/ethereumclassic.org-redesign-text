# What is a blockchain?
Put simply, blockchains provide a way to keep track of digitized value without the need for intermediaries, such as banks and other financial institutions.

# What is Ethereum Classic?
Ethereum Classic (ETC) is a blockchain, a network, a community, and a cryptocurrency that takes digitized value further. In addition to allowing people to send value to each other, ETC allows people to create complex contracts that operate autonomously and cannot be modified or censored. This can be a difficult concept to grasp for those new to the blockchain space. For now, imagine Bitcoin as a landline phoneâ€”it does one thing very well. From this perspective, ETC is like a smartphone it can do everything BTC can, but it is also capable of much more.

ETC is also:
* A fair and open community
* A blockchain with a long history of operation
* A blockchain on which all transactions are immutable, or permanent; if someone sends you value on the ETC blockchain, it is yours forever
* The future of the internet of things (IoT)

# Why ETC?
Immutability. Technology. Community.

## Immutability
ETC "accounts" cannot be modified by others. This feature is a philosophy we share with Bitcoin, Litecoin, and other cryptocurrencies.

Some blockchains follow a different philosophy ("governance") which allows participants to use their social and economic power to vote on the account balances of others. Imagine if all the members of your bank believed you had broken a law. Instead of going to the police, those with the biggest balances and notoriety voted to take away your money. Imagine a system where the wealthy and celebrities have the final say over your money. A fundamental aspect of ETC is that this will never be allowed to happen, and historical precedent has demonstrated this to be the case.

## Technology
ETC allows highly efficient value transfers (more so than Bitcoin and its variants), has a focus on IoT applications, and runs a mathematically verified Ethereum Virtual Machine, or EVM. What this means is that ETC is great at what it sets out to do: be a highly efficient means of exchange that connects the world's devices.

IoT features are under active development and will be available later this year.

## Community
Many blockchain communities have centralized leadership, meaning a few people at the top make the decisions for everyone else. ETC's community is purposely structured to avoid this. Responsibility for development and for other parts of the community are distributed between many parties. This prevents the biased form of "governance" that other blockchains are susceptible to.

# Using ETC (Beginner)
ETC is one of the easiest chains to use, and if you're just getting started you can quickly start using ETC with Emerald Wallet.
## Emerald Wallet - Quick Start
Download: https://github.com/ETCDEVTeam/emerald-wallet/releases
Run.
Select "Remote Node" (starts instantly), or "Full Node" (takes a few hours).

That's it!

# Getting ETC
You have two options to get ETC, one is to buy it on an exchange, the other is to mine it with computer hardware.

## Exchanges
To obtain ETC you can join one of the many exchanges linked in the [Exchange](/#exchange) section.

## Mining
To mine ETC you'll need to have the appropriate computer hardware and join one of the many [ETC mining pools](/#pools) available. If you've never mined before then make sure to read up on what's required first. You can find many guides and information in the mining pools section.

# ETC History
ETC has a long history relative to most blockchains and came about at the start of the second wave of blockchains.

Ultimately you can break down blockchains and Cryptocurrencies into two waves:

Wave 1 (2009-2013): Bitcoin, and Bitcoin clones (aka. "altcoins").
Wave 2 (2014-Present): Contract coins, Privacy coins, etc.

Ethereum Classic belongs to the second wave of coins.

Ethereum Classic is the Ethereum blockchain, much like Coca Cola Classic is the original and better Coke, we are the original and better Ethereum. Where-as New Coke (or New Ethereum) is a compromise that ruined a lot of what made Ethereum great.

## A History Lesson
Ethereum launched on July 30th 2015. At this time there was only one Ethereum with the goal of being a decentralized, immutable, blockchain-powered machine.

ETC's very own EtherNinja is permanently recorded in block 4: https://etherscan.io/block/4

The first Bitcoin-proponent made it into block 18, funny that they were mining Ethereum: https://etherscan.io/block/18

For the first year the Ethereum community was one small but happy family. 

### The DAO Incident
Then some of the leaders at Slock.It and The Ethereum Foundation decided to create a Decentralized Autonomous Organization ("The DAO"). The goal of The DAO was to create a funding mechanism for various ecosystem projects.

The DAO had a litany of issues from the start, it was quickly written, it had known bugs (one of which the attacker exploited), it had undergone a very poor security audit, and it was heavily promoted.

Ultimately a contract was deployed on the Ethereum chain that created The DAO. Participants could send Ether to it, vote on proposals, and be rewarded with Ether if these proposals created profitable projects.

Shortly after deployment The DAO contained ~15% of all Ether in existence at the time (worth ~$150 million), the attacker took about 40% of this (or $60 million). A group of "whitehats" secured the rest, preventing the attacker from getting the whole bag.

A vote was quickly held on carbonvote.com, over the course of a little over a week Ether holders were able to vote with their wallets on whether or not to undo the attack with a change to the network that went against its principles. 6% of the total economy voted, not even a small majority; less Ether than the amount affected by The DAO. 94% did not vote. 94% were not represented.

So Ethereum forked, they [created an irregular state change](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/commit/14bad7e212011337d14e40c9f975efd096ab7418) that undid the past and moved The DAO funds to a refund contract so people could reclaim their Ether.

### Aftermath
After The DAO incident the original agreement for The DAO (which stated that the code on the network is the final say), the daohub.org website, and carbonvote.com all lost their history. Some were taken down quickly (The DAO agreement), the rest disappeared over time. Daohub.org now links to a website for a children's game. Rather loose handling of information related to a $60 million incident.

Finally, the original Ethereum chain continued on, now under the name Ethereum Classic. While Ethereum Foundation should have renamed their augmented chain to something like "New Ethereum" they refused to, and since they had the domain names, the subreddits, and most of the money, they got to "win" with their 6% vote.

### To the Future
Detractors will tell you that ETC stopped here, that all we have are our principles and nothing else. As if principles are cheap. This is a misinformed lie at best and a deliberate lie at worst.

ETC has some of the largest network activity of any blockchain, consistently higher than Bitcoin Cash, and neck-and-neck with Litecoin. We have 3 developer teams, all of whom are committed to the long term ETC vision. We are in the top-10 in programmer activity (measured by code commits). We have numerous sources of funding, and we continue to grow, day-by-day, commit-by-commit, line-by-line of code to create a bullet-proof network.
